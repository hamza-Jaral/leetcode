# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to the LeetCode Solutions repository! This repository is dedicated to storing solutions for various LeetCode coding challenges. Each solution is organized by problem number and follows a specific naming convention for easy reference.

## Naming Convention

The naming convention for the solution files is as follows:

- `xxx`: The problem number on LeetCode.
- `problem_name`: The name of the problem on LeetCode.

For example, if you are solving problem number 123 and the problem is named "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock," the corresponding file would be:
